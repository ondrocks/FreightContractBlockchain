Freight Contract API
=================
This API provides a REST Endpoint so that a SAP TM system can push a Freight Agreement from the On Premise System to Blockchain. 

In the ocean business it is pretty common to have "Uncontrolled Shipments" where the shipper instructs the LSP (Logistics Service Provider) to use the carrier of the shipper choice. In these cases for the LSP it becomes and uncontrolled shipment. The shipper chooses the LSP from an operations point of view only. 

Here the LSP would have to use the contract that has been negotiated between the shipper and the carrier.
